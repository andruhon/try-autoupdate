# Try Autoupdate
Experimenting with github autoupdate https://github.com/chinthakagodawita/autoupdate/

See [.github/build.yml](.github/build.yml) and [.github/autoupdate.yml](.github/autoupdate.yml)

The autoupdate.yml has chinthakagodawita/autoupdate as a first job, and then does another job finding all labelled PRs and triggering a workflow for them.

Some fiddeling with repo settings was also necessary.
